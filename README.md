# Unity-FirstPersonController
Hobby Project, for getting better at C# &amp; related languages, as well as the Unity Game Engine. Not intended to do much, just practice!

This is to help me get a better grip on how Unity and C# function both individually and in unison. 
It was a deep dive going for a 3D game before a 2D, but I'm getting the hang of things.

If you wish to judge my code, you are welcome to go to Assets/Scripts for most of my code. Feel free to add an issue if something is wrong or could be done better.
Also feel free to submit a pull request, if for some reason you have a reason to do that.
